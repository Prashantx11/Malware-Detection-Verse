# Malware-Detection-Verse
**Overview**
Malware Detection Verse is a Python-based malware detection tool designed to scan directories for malicious files using predefined malware signatures. The tool is built with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. The application not only detects potential threats but also allows users to delete detected malware directly from the interface.
<br />

**Features**
<br />
**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A modern, easy-to-use interface for scanning directories and managing detected malware.
<br />
**Location-Based Scanning:** Choose specific directories to scan for malware.
<br />
**Malware Detection:** Identifies files containing malware signatures.
<br />
**Malware Deletion:** Option to delete detected malicious files directly from the GUI.
<br />
**Detailed Results:** Displays comprehensive information about detected malware, including file location, name, and size.
<br />
**Multiple Signature Files**: Supports scanning using multiple signature files for better malware detection coverage.
<br />
**Clear Data Functionality:** Allows users to clear all scanned data and reset the tool for new scans.
<br />

**Installation Process**
<br />
Clone the Repository\n
<br />
git clone https://github.com/Prashantx11/Malware-Detection-Verse.git
<br />
cd malware-detection-verse
<br />
**Install Required Dependencies**
<br />
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher). Install the required Python libraries by running:
<br />
pip install -r requirements.txt
<br />
Run the Application
<br />
Start the application by executing:
<br />
python3 scan.py

**#Requirements**

The following Python libraries are required for running the tool:
<br />
tkinter
<br />
Pillow
<br />
Note: Tkinter is usually included with Python installations. Pillow is used for handling image processing tasks.
<br />
**Usage**
Starting the Tool:
<br />
Run the scan.py script to launch the Malware Detection Verse GUI.
<br />
Using the Interface:
**Choose Location:** Select the directory you want to scan by clicking the "Choose Location" button.
<br />
**Scan:** The tool will scan the selected directory for files containing malware signatures.<br />
View Results: If malware is detected, the results will be displayed, showing the file location, name, and size.<br />
Delete Malware: Click the "Delete Malware" button to remove detected malicious files from your system.<br />
More Info: Click the "More Info" button to get detailed information about the scanned locations and results.<br />
Clear All Data: Click the "Clear All Data" button to reset the tool and clear all previous scan data.<br />
Structure
scan.py: The main script that launches the GUI and connects the front-end with the back-end processing.<br />
MalwareDetector.py: Contains the MalwareDetector class, responsible for managing malware signatures and detecting malware in files.<br />
process.py: Handles the scanning process, file management, and interaction with the MalwareDetector.<br />
lists.py: Custom module for handling various list-based operations.<br />
result.py: Provides functionality to display detailed results in a separate window.<br />
requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the tool.<br />

**Adding New Signatures**
To enhance the detection capability, you can add new malware signatures by updating the signature files (e.g., blackbook.txt and blackbook2.txt). Ensure that each signature is on a new line within the text files.<br />
