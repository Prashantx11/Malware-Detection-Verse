# Malware-Detection-Verse
**Overview**
Malware Detection Verse is a Python-based malware detection tool designed to scan directories for malicious files using predefined malware signatures. The tool is built with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. The application not only detects potential threats but also allows users to delete detected malware directly from the interface.
<br />

**Features**
<br />
**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A modern, easy-to-use interface for scanning directories and managing detected malware.
<br />
**Location-Based Scanning:** Choose specific directories to scan for malware.
<br />
**Malware Detection:** Identifies files containing malware signatures.
<br />
**Malware Deletion:** Option to delete detected malicious files directly from the GUI.
**Detailed Results:** Displays comprehensive information about detected malware, including file location, name, and size.
**Multiple Signature Files**: Supports scanning using multiple signature files for better malware detection coverage.
**Clear Data Functionality:** Allows users to clear all scanned data and reset the tool for new scans.

**Installation Process**
Clone the Repository\n
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection-verse.git
cd malware-detection-verse
Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher). Install the required Python libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application

Start the application by executing:
python scan.py

**#Requirements**

The following Python libraries are required for running the tool:
tkinter
Pillow
Note: Tkinter is usually included with Python installations. Pillow is used for handling image processing tasks.

**Usage**
Starting the Tool:

Run the scan.py script to launch the Malware Detection Verse GUI.
Using the Interface:

**Choose Location:** Select the directory you want to scan by clicking the "Choose Location" button.
**Scan:** The tool will scan the selected directory for files containing malware signatures.
View Results: If malware is detected, the results will be displayed, showing the file location, name, and size.
Delete Malware: Click the "Delete Malware" button to remove detected malicious files from your system.
More Info: Click the "More Info" button to get detailed information about the scanned locations and results.
Clear All Data: Click the "Clear All Data" button to reset the tool and clear all previous scan data.
Structure
scan.py: The main script that launches the GUI and connects the front-end with the back-end processing.
MalwareDetector.py: Contains the MalwareDetector class, responsible for managing malware signatures and detecting malware in files.
process.py: Handles the scanning process, file management, and interaction with the MalwareDetector.
lists.py: Custom module for handling various list-based operations.
result.py: Provides functionality to display detailed results in a separate window.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the tool.
Adding New Signatures
To enhance the detection capability, you can add new malware signatures by updating the signature files (e.g., blackbook.txt and blackbook2.txt). Ensure that each signature is on a new line within the text files.
